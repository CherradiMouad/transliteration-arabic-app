## What Is Arabic Transcription?
**Arabic transcription** is the act of transcribing Arabic text into Romanized form. The core of the method is to replace Arabic letters with their equivalent Roman letters where possible. In other cases, combinations of letters can be used to approximate the correct sound. This process focuses on the way the language sounds, rather than trying to make a letter-by-letter match.
